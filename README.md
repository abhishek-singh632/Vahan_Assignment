# Headless CMS with React.js Frontend
# Overview
This project is a very rudimentary headless CMS (Content Management System) with extremely basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. It allows users to create different entities with customizable attributes and types. Upon creation, the app automatically generates table definitions in a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. Users can then perform CRUD operations on the entities from the React.js frontend interface.
# Features

# Automatic Table Definition: 
Upon entity creation, the app automatically generates table definitions in an RDBMS.
# CRUD Operations: 
Users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the entities from the React.js frontend interface.
